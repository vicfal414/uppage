              <p>Russell is an enthusiastic and persistent 8-year-old Junior Wilderness Explorer from Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12. Armed with a backpack laden with official Wilderness Explorer camping gear, Russell is ready for the wilderness! There's just one catch: he's never actually left the city. All his knowledge of the outdoors comes from books, and his sole camping experience was in his own living room.</p>

              <p>Carl Fredricksen is not your average hero. He's a retired balloon salesman who, at the age of 78, is forced to leave the house he and his late wife Ellie built together. But instead of moving into the old folks' home, Carl takes action. He ties thousands of balloons to the roof, lifts the house into the air, and sets off toward South America, finally fulfilling the promise he made to his wife so many years before.</p>

              <p>Dug is a lovable golden retriever living in the wilds of Paradise Falls as part of the dog pack searching for a rare flightless bird. Like the rest of his pack, Dug is outfitted with a remarkable high-tech collar that translates his thoughts into speech. But Dug is mocked as the nerd of the pack. Sent into the jungle on a "special" mission, Dug accidentally succeeds when he discovers the bird following Carl and Russell. As they are pursued through the jungle by his own pack, the sweet but simple-minded Dug must decide which pack he actually belongs to.</p>

              <p>Named by Russell, this extremely rare, 13-foot-tall flightless bird is hidden from the world in her remote Paradise Falls habitat. With brilliant iridescent feathers and a long, flexible neck, Kevin is exceptionally fast and nimble despite her size. In fact, the massive bird often gets into some very curious and seemingly impossible positions.

                Very few know that this scientifically invaluable creature exists, but Carl and Russell stumble upon the bird, and Russell names her Kevin after he discovers they share a sweet tooth. Kevin and Russell bond instantly, and despite the bird's propensity to swallow Carl's walker, Kevin joins the jungle's latest and most unlikely pack along with Carl, Russell and Dug.</p>

                <p>Ellie is an exuberant, adventurous girl who dreams of exploring the world. She and Carl first bond over their shared admiration for legendary explorer Charles F. Muntz. They pledge to travel together to Paradise Fallsâ€”the world's tallest waterfall, deep in the South American rainforest. As the couple settle into their married life, their grandiose plans are set aside as they navigate the ups and downs of their everyday lives.</p>

                <p>In the early 1930s, rich, clever, and handsome Charles F. Muntz is a beacon of hope for a down-and-out American public. He inspires his biggest fans, youngsters Carl and Ellie, to parrot his famous mantra "adventure is out there!" Traveling the globe many times over in his massive self-designed airship, he discovers the world's treasures: priceless historic relics, amazing scientific discoveries, and exotic flora and fauna never before seen. But when Muntz brings home the skeleton of a fantastic 13-foot-tall creature from a remote mountain in South America, he is discredited by scientists. Vowing to prove them wrong, Muntz returns to South America, swearing to bring back a live specimen, and he won't come back
                  until he does!</p>
